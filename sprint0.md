# Paper Tower Challenge 
In this assignment, I was tasked with building the tallest standing structure, only using paper: no tape, no glue, no nothing. 

## Goal Setting 
- Build a tower that reaches 1 metre
- Create a visually appealing tower with an interesting design
- Learn from each attempt and iterate on the design to improve the tower's height or stability

## Research
- My main source of information and knowledge to build the tower came from YouTube
- Watching videos of other people making their designs, and choosing the ones I thought would work out best
- For example, the idea to tie a ribbon around the rolled-up sheets came from this video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imaPI3z4gck&ab_channel=STEAMEducation)

## Ideation

- Showing how I would divide my paper
- I first came up with the idea to use a sliver of paper as a ribbon, mimicking tape.
- It would be used to wrap around all the stacked cylinders of paper

- Arrows to show the steps of my plan

## Prototyping 

### Prototype 1:

- Testing the ribbon idea
- Making sure the base is strong enough

### Prototype 2:

- Adding a second cylinder on top to see if the base could support it properly
- It went well and was standing strong

### Prototype 3:

- Added a third, thinner cylinder on top of the second one
- Made the structure unbalanced because of the weight added on top

## Testing and Critique 
- Prototype 3 is the best structure so far
- However, it is quite unstable and can fall easily
- The more I build up the weaker the base becomes

- I will need to make a stronger base
- Instead of going for a pyramid approach from biggest to medium to smallest cylinder
- Have a strong base, strong middle, and 2 very light and weak top cylinders that are connected
- This was the top will not have that much gravitational impact and the weight will not burden the structure

- Design of what prototype 4 will look like

## Final Design

- Uses idea from prototype 4, with four different cylinders all connected 
- Uses idea from prototype 1, with a ribbon on the base and middle, and to connect the top 2 pieces
  
## Conclusion

- In conclusion, the paper tower challenge successfully pushed the height limits achievable with only paper
- The final design achieved a height of 100 cm, reaching my goal
- Future work could explore additional paper folding techniques or structural innovations to further enhance the tower's heigh
- This assessment is tailored for fellow engineering students who wish to learn from and build upon this sprint
- It provides a concise overview of the goals, research, ideation, prototyping, testing, and the final design, offering insights into the decision-making process and lessons learned
